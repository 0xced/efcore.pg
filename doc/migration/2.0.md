# Migrating to 2.0

## New Features

* PostgreSQL extensions are now included in scaffolded models ([#102](https://github.com/npgsql/Npgsql.EntityFrameworkCore.PostgreSQL/issues/102)).

## Upgrading from 1.0.x

* Specifying versions when specifying PostgreSQL extensions on your model is no longer supported - this was a very rarely-used feature which interfered with extension scaffolding.
